	Reviewing the articles, we see that classification models can make useful predictions on large data sets that would be impractical to analyze by hand. For example, sentiment analysis of movie reviews can rapidly analyze thousands of reviews and classify them by positive or negative sentiment with reasonable accuracy. The resulting analysis is also fairly objective, barring any bias implicit in the training data, which can be fixed by providing more and better data if necessary.

	Similarly, analyzing and categorizing spam emails, benign/malignant tumor classification, and wine quality predictions are all accomplished quickly on large data sets. The common thread among these articles is that classification models in machine learning can provide classification results which are objective, fast, and useful, on data sets that would otherwise be extremely difficult to analyze.
